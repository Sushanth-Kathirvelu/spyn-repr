# spyn-repr
Code for representation learning experiments with Sum-Product Networks

## Requirements

### Python packages
The following python 3 packages have been used:
```
numpy 1.10.4
scipy 0.16.1
sklearn 0.17
pandas 0.15.2
theano 0.8.0
matplotlib 1.5.1
seaborn 0.6.0
```

### Numerical libraries
For optimal `theano` and `numpy` performances one can exploit the
`blas` and `lapack` libs. CUDA is required to use the GPU with Theano.
To properly install them please refer to
[this page](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)
The lib versions used are:
```
liblapack3 3.5.0-2
libopenblas-dev 0.2.8-6
cuda 6.0.1
```

### Commands execution
`ipython 3.2.1` has been used to launch all scripts.
The following commands will assume the use of `ipython` and being in
the repo main directory:
```
cd spyn-repr
```
